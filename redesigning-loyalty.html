											<p>In 2017, the underlying technology powering JetBlue's TrueBlue program was outdated. The customer-facing digital experience was inaccessible on mobile devices, the Customer Support tool was clunky, analytics capabilities were limited, and every new feature the Loyalty Marketing team wanted to implement became costly and time consuming. Thus, JetBlue took on an initiative to modernize the program and its underlying platform.</p>

											<p>As Lead Business Analyst for loyalty products at JetBlue at the time, my role on this project was to serve as product design lead partnering with a digital design agency for the UI and UX of an entirely new customer-facing experience, work with Loyalty Marketing stakeholders to redesign aspects of the program, and document requirements for the Engineering and QA teams.</p>

											<p>Redesigning a digital experience for a program with millions of members is never an easy task, yet it was a necessary one given that the old site completely lacked a mobile experience and strayed from the recent evolutions in JetBlue's Digital Brand Design System. Partnering with an agency based in Brooklyn, we iteratively redesigned all sections of <a href="https://trueblue.jetblue.com/dashboard/my-points" target="_blank" title="TrueBlue dashboard">the experience</a>. We conducted user testing, designed for mobile devices first, and strove for simplicity. We introduced visual patterns that recognized elite tier Mosaic members and JetBlue Card holders acknowledging their loyalty. We encouraged deeper engagement with the program by prominently displaying partners that the individual member has not yet earned points with. We resolved customer pain points from the older experience like the child enrollment flow that drove customers to call into our Customer Support center. Finally, we delivered a modular design that could more easily accommodate additional sections should the program wish to move in that direction.

											<p>Originally <a href="https://skift.com/2013/10/10/jetblue-enables-points-sharing-for-families-of-all-shapes/" target="_blank" title="JetBlue Enables Points-Sharing For Families of All Shapes">launched as "Family Pooling" </a> in 2013, TrueBlue was the only U.S. airline to allow families to pool their points for free, and with no blackout or points’ expirations. As other airlines introduced similar programs over time, we wanted to continue to move needle and the new platform we were upgrading to allowed for more flexibility in this space. While the previous program only allowed two adults and five children to pool their points, we redesigned <a href="https://www.jetblue.com/trueblue/points-pooling" target="_blank" title="TrueBlue Points Pooling">the new "Points Pooling" program</a> to allow any group of seven TrueBlue members to pool their points. Given that we had expanded the program beyond families, we also designed new ways for control of the points to be shared amongst pool members and worked with Revenue Accounting to document how these points flowed in and out of our financial systems.</p>

											</figure>

											<p>Another issue we encountered was the lack of documentation from the previous system. If we were to rebuild and test the entire platform the engineers needed something to code against and the testers needed something to validate against. Thus, my fellow team of Business Analysts and I wrote hundreds of user stories, reviewed them with stakeholders, shared them with the teams, and provided clarifications when questions arose.</p>

											<p>With the launch of the new platform in November 2018, the TrueBlue program saw an increase in enrollments, participation in the Points Pooling program, and overall stronger engagement. Additionally, close to 60% of views to the digital experience today come from mobile and tablet devices.</p>
